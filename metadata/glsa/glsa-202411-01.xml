    <description>
        <p>Neat VNC allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a request in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as &#34;Type 1 - None&#34;, which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server, as originally demonstrated using a long password.</p>
    </description>
    <impact type="high">
        <p>A remote attacker can opt not to use any authentication method and access the VNC server.</p>
    </impact>
    <workaround>
        <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
    </workaround>
    <resolution>
        <p>All Neat VNC users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
        
        <code>
          # emerge --sync
          # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gui-libs/neatvnc-0.8.1"
        </code>
