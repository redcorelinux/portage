    <background>
        <p>OpenSSH is a free application suite consisting of server and clients that replace tools like telnet, rlogin, rcp and ftp with more secure versions offering additional functionality.</p>

        <p>A vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSH. Please review the CVE identifier referenced below for details.</p>
    </description>
    <impact type="high">
        <p>A critical vulnerability in sshd(8) was present in Portable OpenSSH
versions that may allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

Successful exploitation has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc
systems with ASLR. Under lab conditions, the attack requires on
average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the
server will accept. Exploitation on 64-bit systems is believed to be
possible but has not been demonstrated at this time. It&#39;s likely that
these attacks will be improved upon.</p>
    </impact>
    <workaround>
        <p>There is no known workaround at this time.

Note that Gentoo has backported the fix to the following versions:

net-misc/openssh-9.6_p1-r5
net-misc/openssh-9.7_p1-r6</p>
    </workaround>
    <resolution>
        <p>All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version and restart the sshd server (to ensure access for new sessions and no vulnerable code keeps running).</p>
        
        <code>
          # emerge --sync
          # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openssh-9.7_p1-r6"
        </code>
        
        <p>With OpenRC:</p>
        
        <code>
          # rc-service sshd restart
        </code>
        
        <p>With systemd:</p>
        
        <code>
          #  systemctl try-restart sshd.service
        </code>
