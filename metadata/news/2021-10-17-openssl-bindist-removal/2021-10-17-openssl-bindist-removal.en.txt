On 2021-11-19, the base-system team will remove USE=bindist
behavior from dev-libs/openssl, per bug #762850 [1].

Users should not experience any ABI incompatibilities that
require recompilation when moving from
dev-libs/openssl[bindist] to dev-libs/openssl[-bindist].

However, moving back in future may recompile if any binaries
of their systems depend on the additional symbols available
with USE=-bindist.

USE=bindist on dev-libs/openssl historically applied RedHat
work, called hobble-openssl [2], that was intended to make
OpenSSL "safe" to distribute with regards to various
patents, in the opinion of RedHat's legal counsel. The
hobble-openssl, in it's last iterations, it greatly
restricted which parts of EC (elliptic curve) were available
[3][4]

Debian & Ubuntu do not apply any similar behavior, and
Gentoo intends to follow Debian's lead with regards to
OpenSSL hobble-openssl moving forward.
