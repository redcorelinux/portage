Packaging Haskell software has proven difficult in Gentoo: many packages are
outdated, unstable versions have not been stabilized in nearly a year, and
stable versions are rather old.

In an effort to reduce the load on the Haskell maintainers, stable keywords
will be removed from dev-haskell/* packages and their reverse dependencies on
October 1.

Users with Haskell packages should add entries to their package.accept_keywords
for these packages to avoid issues rebuilding or upgrading them in the future.

This change does not preclude stabilizing Haskell packages in the future.

Haskell packaging is mostly taking place in the Haskell repository [1].
