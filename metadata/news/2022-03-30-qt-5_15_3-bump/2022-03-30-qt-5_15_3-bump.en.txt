Up until Qt 5.15.2 we were using qtchooser to provide unversioned links to Qt
binaries in PATH, like qmake, moc, qmljs etc. Starting with 5.15.3 [1] such
links will be installed by each respective Qt package and '5'-version-suffixed,
e.g. qmake becomes qmake5, qml becomes qml5 etc., mirroring Qt6.

If you develop with Qt5 and rely on unversioned binaries for your workflow,
dev-qt/qtchooser as a tool for quickly switching between multiple Qt
installations (e.g. Qt3, Qt4 and Qt5) can still be manually installed. The
'default' Qt version in PATH is then controlled via config in
/etc/xdg/qtchooser.

Otherwise, dev-qt/qtchooser will be slated for cleanup on your next
emerge --depclean run.
