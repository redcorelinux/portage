Starting with dracut-102, cryptsetup support for systemd has been moved
into a separate module "systemd-cryptsetup". Under specific conditions,
this change may cause a failure to boot. [1]

Users who are not using cryptsetup at all will not be affected.

Users who use the "dracutmodules" config option to explicitly name all
modules to be included may be affected if they fail to update their
dracut configuration to include the new "systemd-cryptsetup" module.

Users who have not altered the default config or who are not using the
"dracutmodules" option should not be affected.

The dracut.conf(5) manual page warns against using "dracutmodules".
Instead, "add_dracutmodules" and "omit_dracutmodules" can be used to
to alter the default module list with less risk of omiting modules by
accident.
