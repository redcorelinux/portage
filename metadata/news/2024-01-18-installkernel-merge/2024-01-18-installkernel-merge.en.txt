Display-If-Installed: sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd-boot

The functionalities of sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo and
sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd have been merged into sys-kernel/installkernel.

sys-kernel/installkernel now provides the systemd USE flag to switch between
the traditional installkernel (formerly sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo) and
systemd's kernel-install (formerly sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd(-boot)).

Additionally, the new sys-kernel/installkernel with the systemd flag enabled
now provides a default install.conf configuration file which ensures that it
will work out-of-the-box with no configuration (other then USE flag
configuration) required for most setups.

Details on configuration and customization can be found on the installkernel
wiki page [1]. Below we provide the most important migration notes.


User Action Required (GRUB users)
====================

Previously sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo provided kernel installation
automation for users of GRUB via USE=grub. The new sys-kernel/installkernel
provides the same functionality, which now works with both the traditional
installkernel and systemd's kernel-install. In principle no user action is
required unless users wish to explicitly choose either the traditional
installkernel or systemd's kernel-install, in which case they may do so
via USE=-/+systemd.

sys-kernel/installkernel is renamed from sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo,
therefore no user action is required to upgrade.


User Action Required (systemd-boot users)
====================

Previously sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd provided kernel installation
automation for users of systemd-boot. sys-kernel/installkernel provides
the same functionality but only via systemd's kernel-install. Users
of systemd-boot should therefore ensure that the "systemd" USE flag is enabled
when upgrading to >=sys-kernel/installkernel-14.

Users who are using the distribution kernels (i.e. gentoo-kernel(-bin)) should
enable the "dracut" USE flag on installkernel as well to pull in and enable
the dracut initramfs generator. This is enforced by portage.

The upgrade path is enforced by sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd-4, which is
just a wrapper pulling in >=sys-kernel/installkernel-14 with the "systemd" flag
enabled. sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd may be removed after installing
>=sys-kernel/installkernel-14.

emerge --noreplace sys-kernel/installkernel
emerge --depclean sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd


User Action Required (users of other bootloaders and custom scripts)
====================

Users who have previously relied on custom installkernel or kernel-install
plugins should either ensure that the same kernel installation method will be
used after upgrading to >=sys-kernel/installkernel-14 (via USE=+/-systemd) or
migrate these custom plugins (details are on the wiki [1]).
