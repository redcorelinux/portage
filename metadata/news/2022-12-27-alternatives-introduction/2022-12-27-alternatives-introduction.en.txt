Gentoo is introducing a new category of ebuilds called 'app-alternatives'
to handle cases where a symlink for a common binary may want to be switched
between different packages by a user.

Traditionally, eselect was used for this, and while eselect still has its
place, it's unsuitable for cases like /bin/awk and /bin/sh because it
prevents immutable system directories and (more importantly
from a package management perspective) relies on orphaned symlinks which
means no package owns /bin/awk, /bin/sh, etc. This is not reliable and
can lead to dead symlinks (or no symlink at all) in some edge cases [0].

Systems will be more robust and desired system configuration
can be achieved using the package manager rather than manual steps outside of it.

The initial list of packages which support alternatives is as follows:
- app-alternatives/awk
- app-alternatives/bzip2
- app-alternatives/bc
- app-alternatives/cpio
- app-alternatives/gzip
- app-alternatives/lex
- app-alternatives/sh
- app-alternatives/tar
- app-alternatives/yacc

The stabilization of these new ebuilds and packages depending
on them occurred on 2022-12-27 in bug 886017 [1].

## Pre-upgrade requirements

The default configuration on Gentoo systems is FEATURES="protect-owned"
which works similarly to FEATURES="collision-protect" but it allows
collisions between orphaned files. In this case, a one-off collision
occurs as the app-alternatives/ ebuilds begin to claim once-orphaned
symlinks.

A similar issue occurred during the libxcrypt migration where users
had upgrades interrupted by using the older, more aggressive
FEATURES="collision-protect".

It is recommended that users alter their configuration to
remove references to 'collision-protect' in FEATURES and instead either
explicitly enable 'protect-owned' in FEATURES or rely on the default
(equivalent). It is also acceptable to simply disable collision-protect
temporarily for the purposes of this news item.

WARNING: Users with collision-protect enabled must disable FEATURES="collision-protect"
in /etc/portage/make.conf by removing it or setting FEATURES="-collision-protect"
if they have enabled it. collision-protect detects collisions between files including
orphaned files where no package owns the file.

## Migrating

When receiving this news item, please follow the step below as soon
as possible to ensure a smooth transition.

To migrate your system, a standard world upgrade will suffice after
deselecting eselect-awk and eselect-sh:
1. # emerge --deselect app-eselect/eselect-awk app-eselect/eselect-sh
2. # emerge --depclean app-eselect/eselect-awk app-eselect/eselect-sh
3. # emerge --sync
4. # emerge -a -uvDU @world (or other similar standard world upgrade command)
5. # emerge --ask --depclean

It's okay if nothing happens in Step 1 and Step 2 (no atoms to remove).

## Configuration

Users who are not interested in using different implementations for
various tools listed above can ignore this section.

No configuration should be required by default, but users may wish
to configure the new app-alternatives/ ebuilds to their tastes as they
used to do via e.g. eselect-sh and eselect-awk.

Going forward, /etc/portage/package.use will be used for this purpose.

Users should review the USE flags available for the various app-alternatives
ebuilds like app-alternatives/sh and adjust their configuration as desired.

For example, to have /bin/gzip be provided by app-arch/pigz for automatic
parallelization of 'gzip', one would have the following in /etc/portage/package.use:
```
# https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gzip#Parallelization
# Make /bin/gzip be a symlink to pigz for a speedup in compression
app-alternatives/gzip -reference pigz
```
