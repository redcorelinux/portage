The sys-apps/systemd-utils package was recently added to the gentoo
repository. This replaces sys-apps/systemd-tmpfiles,
sys-boot/systemd-boot, and sys-fs/udev with a single package. USE flags
are provided to allow each component to be enabled or disabled. This
change was made to significantly ease maintenance of tools split out
from systemd.

When upgrading to sys-apps/systemd-tmpfiles-250,
sys-apps/systemd-utils[tmpfiles] will be pulled in as a dependency.

When upgrading to sys-boot/systemd-boot-250,
sys-apps/systemd-utils[boot] will be pulled in as a dependency.

When upgrading to sys-fs/udev-250, sys-apps/systemd-utils[udev] will be
pulled in as a dependency.

At a later date, sys-apps/systemd-tmpfiles, sys-boot/systemd-boot, and
sys-fs/udev will be masked for removal once a suitable version of
sys-apps/systemd-utils has been marked stable and sufficient time has
been provided for users to migrate.

Possible problems when upgrading:

1. If sys-fs/eudev is present in the world file (@selected), emerge will
   abort the upgrade with a unsolvable blocker error. To resolve this,
   either remove sys-fs/eudev from the world file
   (emerge --deselect sys-fs/eudev), or disable the 'udev' USE flag for
   sys-apps/systemd-utils.

2. The 'boot' USE flag on sys-apps/systemd-utils is disabled by default.
   Users migrating from sys-boot/systemd-boot will need to enable the
   'boot' USE flag (in package.use) to continue receiving updates.
