RSS Guard database files created by RSS Guard version 3.9.x are
incompatible with RSS Guard version 4.0 or later [0].

Configuration file (config.ini) is fully backwards compatible according
to the upstream. You can save it (File -> Backup settings) before an
upgrade and restore it later (File -> Restore settings).

There is no reliable way to automate the database format conversion, so
action from the user is required before an upgrade can take place.

The first option would be to export your feeds as an OMPL file
(Accounts -> Export feeds) before an upgrade and import them later
(Account -> Import feeds).

The second option would be to manually update your database.db file to
4.x.x format following a guide by the upstream developer [1].

Keep in mind that application data directory has been renamed from
"~/.config/RSS Guard" to "~/.config/RSS Guard 4".
