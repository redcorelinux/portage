Formerly, we packaged kubernetes as seven separate packages:

sys-cluster/kubeadm, sys-cluster/kube-apiserver,
sys-cluster/kube-controller-manager, sys-cluster/kubectl,
sys-cluster/kubelet, sys-cluster/kube-proxy and
sys-cluster/kube-scheduler.

Starting with kubernetes 1.18.0, 1.17.5 and 1.16.9, these will be merged
into one package, sys-cluster/kubernetes. The components of this package
which are build and installed will be selectable by use flags.

If you are using 1.16.x or 1.17.x and would like to migrate to the
single package without upgrading, I have also made 1.16.8 and 1.17.4
available in this new package.

Currently, everything is built and installed by default; however, I am
open to changing this if there is a better way to configure the default
build.
