Gentoo's OpenSSH package will start using the /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d
and /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d directories for both Gentoo default settings
and use by the administrator.

The default /etc/ssh/sshd_config and /etc/ssh/ssh_config files will
respectively include configuration files in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/* and
/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*, making it possible for all customization and
configuration to be done via 'drop-in' files if desired.

Most users will not need to take any action. The only action required
is if specific Gentoo defaults were overridden in the past, as the new
ebuilds will install them to new files in the new listed directories.

Such admins will need to edit the new files in the new directories or
make overrides in their own files in the new directories using a smaller
number in the filename.

For example, if the system administrator has commented out 'AcceptEnv COLORTERM'
in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, they will need to do the same in the new
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/9999999gentoo.conf file.
