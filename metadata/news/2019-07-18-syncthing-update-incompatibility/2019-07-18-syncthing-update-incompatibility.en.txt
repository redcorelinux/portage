Starting with version 1.2.0, Syncthing always uses large, variable-sized,
blocks to index and transfer files larger than 256 MiB [1]. Syncthing
version 0.14.45 and older will initially appear to accept files scanned
with large blocks, but will later panic during some internal file
operations. Do NOT enable large blocks in clusters with devices still
on v0.14.45 or older, e.g. Debian Stretch servers using official packages.
