The sys-apps/busybox package was recently removed from the system set.
Users of net-misc/netifrc may have unknowingly relied upon this package
to provide a DHCP client.

If you are using netifrc and use DHCP for network connectivity, please
ensure you have a supported DHCP client installed/selected in the
Portage world file.

Supported clients include:

dhcpcd provided by net-misc/dhcpcd
dhclient provided by net-misc/dhcp
udhcpc provided by sys-apps/busybox
