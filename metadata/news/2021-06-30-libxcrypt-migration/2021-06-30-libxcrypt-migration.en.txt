The implementation of libcrypt.so within glibc has been deprecated
for a long time and will be removed in the near future.

For this reason, we are following other distributions (where
this has been tested for years already) and switching to the 
external libxcrypt implementation, starting with ~arch 
installations.

This will be a regular update, and in nearly all cases you
will not have to take any action and not observe any problems.

We do recommend, however, that your system is *fully* up
to date first. This is a standard recommendation but in this
specific case, it is useful to have a simplified depgraph
to ensure that Portage is able to smoothly calculate
an upgrade path.

That is, please take the opportunity to fully upgrade your
systems now, before the migration occurs, to simplify matters.

This change will occur on 2021-07-14 for ~arch users. Stable
users will update at a later date.

If for whatever reason you do *not* wish to switch now -
which is only delaying the inevitable - you
need to take the following steps:
* unmask and enable the crypt USE flag of sys-libs/glibc
* mask the system USE flag of sys-libs/libxcrypt
* mask >=virtual/libcrypt-2

If you wish to manually migrate now, there are a series
of steps described on the wiki (see below), but the outline is:
* unforce the crypt USE flag of sys-libs/glibc and disable it
* unmask the system and split-usr (if applicable) USE flag of sys-libs/libxcrypt
and enable it
* unmask ~virtual/libcrypt-2
