		This project is a port of the Prettier formatter to the Ada programming
		language. The aim of this project is to provide a tool that allows Ada
		programmers to create formatters for any language of their choosing.
		Please note that only the core generic formatting algorithm and its
		dependencies were ported. The formatters for all supported languages
		are not included in this project.
