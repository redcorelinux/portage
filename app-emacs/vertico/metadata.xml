  <longdescription>
    Vertico provides a performant and minimalistic vertical completion UI
    based on the default completion system. The focus of Vertico is to
    provide a UI which behaves correctly under all circumstances. By reusing
    the built-in facilities system, Vertico achieves full compatibility with
    built-in Emacs completion commands and completion tables. Vertico only
    provides the completion UI but aims to be highly flexible, extendable
    and modular. Additional enhancements are available as extensions or
    complementary packages.
