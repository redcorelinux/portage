    Consult provides search and navigation commands based on the Emacs
    completion function completing-read. Completion allows you to quickly
    select an item from a list of candidates. Consult offers asynchronous
    and interactive consult-grep and consult-ripgrep commands, and the
    line-based search command consult-line. Furthermore Consult provides an
    advanced buffer switching command consult-buffer to switch between
    buffers, recently opened files, bookmarks and buffer-like candidates
    from other sources. Some of the Consult commands are enhanced versions
    of built-in Emacs commands. For example the command consult-imenu
    presents a flat list of the Imenu with live preview, grouping and
    narrowing. Consult is fully compatible with completion systems centered
    around the standard Emacs completing-read API, notably the default
    completion system, Vertico, Mct, and Icomplete.
