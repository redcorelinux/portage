    vopono is a tool to run applications through VPN tunnels via temporary network namespaces. This
    allows you to run only a handful of applications through different VPNs simultaneously, whilst
    keeping your main connection as normal.

    vopono includes built-in killswitches for both Wireguard and OpenVPN.
