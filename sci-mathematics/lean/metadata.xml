    The Lean theorem prover is a proof assistant developed principally
    by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research.  Lean is a functional
    programming language that makes it easy to write correct and
    maintainable code. You can also use Lean as an interactive theorem
    prover. Lean programming primarily involves defining types and
    functions. This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and
    manipulating its data, rather than the details of programming.
